# Employee_tracker

## Description
This app.js file is part of a Node.js command-line application that leverages the Inquirer.js library to provide an interactive user interface. It enables users to perform various operations related to managing a simple HR database, such as viewing all departments, roles, and employees, adding new departments, roles, and employees, and updating existing employee roles. The application makes use of asynchronous JavaScript to handle user inputs and database interactions efficiently. Each user action is processed through a switch statement that calls specific functions to perform the requested operation, with inputs validated through Inquirer.js prompts. The application supports recursive navigation, allowing users to return to the main menu after completing an action, and includes basic error handling to manage exceptions gracefully.
